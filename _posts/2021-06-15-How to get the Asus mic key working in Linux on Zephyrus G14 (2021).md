## Preamble

The mic mute key that ships with the Asus Zephyrus G14 functions normally on Windows, but on Linux it is not recognised by most distros. The fix listed on the [Asus-Linux's FAQ page](https://asus-linux.org/faq/#mic-mute-doesn-t-work){:target="blank"} did not work for me after multiple tries, so I had to dig around a bit and finally found a way using `acpi`. It took a while, but the mic mute key is finally working normally on Zephyrus G14 2021 loaded with Kubuntu 21.04!

Read on to get it working yourself as well! I have included all the scripts I used towards the end as well.

## Steps

These are the steps you need to follow:

1. Figure out the key event for the mic mute key. Execute `acpi_listen` on the terminal and press the mic mute key. The event identifier will be printed on the terminal.

2. Configure PulseAudio to run system-wide using [this helpful blog](https://fhackts.wordpress.com/2017/07/01/running-pulseaudio-system-wide-with-pacmd-on-arch/){:target="blank"} (reason is explained at the end). Restart the system.

3. (**Optional**) For some reason, after following the last step and restarting my system, my user got removed from the `sudoers` list and I couldn't use `sudo` anymore. If this happens with you, follow [this blog](https://www.tecmint.com/fix-user-is-not-in-the-sudoers-file-the-incident-will-be-reported-ubuntu/){:target="blank"} and it should be fixed.

4. Once this is done, run `sudo PULSE_RUNTIME_PATH=/var/run/pulse -u pulse pacmd list-sources | grep index` . This will give you a list of indices for all the input sources connected to your system. If you want to use a USB microphone or something else, attach that too so that you can note all the indices.

5. For me, the indices were 0, 1 and 2. Create a file at `/etc/acpi/asus-mutemic.sh` and put the following bit of code inside it. As you can observe there is a recurring piece of code for every index. Add more indices or reduce the existing ones as per your setup. This script will mute *all* these indices when the mute mic button is pressed. 

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/IAmSuyogJadhav/3b265936e4f8fb8e144802d4dcf086e6.js"></script>
    
    Make the script executable: `sudo chmod +x /etc/acpi/asus-mutemic.sh`

6. Create another file  at `/etc/acpi/events/asus-mutemic` and put the following code inside it:

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/IAmSuyogJadhav/2b954ebfd052c21fd1e408311845dd6e.js"></script>
    This file will be responsible for listening to the keypress event and invoking the script we wrote earlier. Note that, if you got a different event code in the first step, put that after `event=` in the above file.

7. Finally, restart acpid: `sudo /etc/init.d/acpid reload`. You may need to restart the computer if the key does not start working right away.

And that should be it! Do let me know if it works for you too! If you know a better way of doing this, please advise in the comments below!

## Scripts

- `/etc/acpi/asus-mutemic.sh`: [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/IAmSuyogJadhav/3b265936e4f8fb8e144802d4dcf086e6){:target="blank"}
- `/etc/acpi/events/asus-mutemic`: [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/IAmSuyogJadhav/2b954ebfd052c21fd1e408311845dd6e){:target="blank"}

## Footnotes

- The step 2 is needed because the action triggered by acpi events run as the root user, and the way PulseAudio is setup by default, it does not allow anyone (not even root) to modify the PulseAudio settings. The PulseAudio system mode was made for making that possible.

- In the step 5, the commented-out line of code was meant to automate the process of gathering indices and muting all of them, but that didn't work for some unknown reason. If you figure out why, please let me know in the comments.

- Note that doing this makes it so that you won't be able to adjust the volume through PulseAudio's volume control GUI. I am pretty sure it will require some additional config from the user's end to get it functioning, but I am using Plasma DE which has a nice little applet for volume control that functions well despite this so it didn't create a big issue for me. If you absolutely need to use the `pavucontrol` GUI, there might be some tweaking required get the GUI functioning.
